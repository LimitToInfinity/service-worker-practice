## Service Worker Practice

This app makes a request to the Pokemon API, retrieves Pikachu, and displays some things on the page.

Your job is to intercept the request and replace it with Charmander so the app will work offline.

## Steps

1. Register a service worker
2. Immediately activate it
3. Intercept fetch requests to the pokemon API
4. Respond with a static response

You don't need to change anything in the `index.html` or `app.js` files to do this. Good luck!
